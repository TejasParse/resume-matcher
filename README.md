## About Resume-Matcher
- A system to perform keyword searches on CV/Resume and rank them by keyword matches. 
- Resumes are loaded in the documents folder on the server and indexes are generated.
- Once the indexes are generated, the client makes API calls to the server and fetches resumes based on the BM25 Scores.
- The main aim was to build a good information retrieval system. 
- The Client does have several features that one would need.

## How to use
Copy all your resume PDFs in the _/dependency/documents/_ folder. Run the _main.py_ and enter your search query.
